🍔 Food App Microservices Project
This project is a cloud-native microservices application designed to simulate a real-world food ordering platform. It demonstrates end-to-end DevOps practices with modern tooling, including Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD.
________________________________________
🚀 Project Overview
The Food App is composed of four microservices, each owning its own database:
•	🛒 Order Service – Manages customer orders
•	👤 User Service – Handles user registration and authentication
•	🍽️ Menu Service – Stores and serves restaurant menus
•	💳 Payment Service – Processes and verifies payments
Each service is fully containerized with Docker, deployed in Kubernetes, and exposed through an Ingress Controller behind a Load Balancer.

🏗️ Architecture
Key Features:
•	Microservices with independent databases (true separation of concerns)
•	Kubernetes Ingress Controller acting as API Gateway for smart routing
•	Cloud Load Balancer for high availability and scalability
•	CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated build and container image publishing
•	GitOps with ArgoCD to automatically sync and deploy changes into Kubernetes
High-Level Flow:
1.	User request → Ingress Controller (API Gateway)
2.	Ingress routes request → Correct microservice
3.	Service → Connects to its own database
4.	Updates are pushed to GitHub → GitHub Actions build & push Docker image
5.	ArgoCD detects repo changes → Syncs to Kubernetes cluster

⚙️ Tech Stack
•	Backend: Node.js  (per microservice)
•	Databases: PostgreSQL / MySQL (per service)
•	Containerization: Docker
•	Orchestration: Kubernetes
•	Traffic Management: Ingress Controller + Load Balancer
•	CI/CD: GitHub Actions
•	GitOps Deployment: ArgoCD

🔄 CI/CD Workflow
1.	GitHub Actions
o	Runs on every push/merge
o	Builds and tests microservice images
o	Pushes images to container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry)
2.	ArgoCD (GitOps)
o	Watches the k8s-manifests/ repo
o	Syncs manifests automatically to Kubernetes cluster
o	Ensures cluster state always matches Git repo
